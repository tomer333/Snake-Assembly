# Snake-Assembly
<p>Snake is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. I chose this game because I was interested in how this lovely and classy game would operate in assembly. This game was one of my favorite games and was excited to write it by myself in assembly.</p>
